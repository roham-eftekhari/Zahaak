## Program Overview

**Zahhak – A Symphonic Poem** is a programmatic orchestral work based on the legendary tale of Zahhak from *Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh*. The piece is divided into three major phases, each depicting key narrative arcs through contrasting musical styles, motifs, and textures. The music explores themes of corruption, seduction, tyranny, resistance, and rebirth, blending Western orchestral techniques with Persian modal and rhythmic aesthetics.

## Phase I – Prologue (Dusk)

This opening section sets a suspenseful and neutral emotional tone, reflecting the state of Iran under a weak and unworthy ruler. Two contrasting themes are introduced: **Zahhak’s Leitmotif** and **Ahriman’s Seduction Theme**, which begin to entangle as the narrative darkens.

### Zahhak Leitmotif
Introduced in trombones and cellos, Zahhak’s theme reflects both his naivety and eventual corruption.  
The melodic line incorporates a **Dies Irae** reference and is based on an **octatonic scale (H–W)**, using the pitch sequence `6, 5, 6, 4, 5, 3`.

> In F♯ minor: `C♯–C–C♯–B♭–C–A → cadence on F♯m–F`

### Ahriman Seduction Theme
Ahriman, the personification of evil, is portrayed by a solo violin. The theme uses a **Petrushka-like progression**:

> `F♯/C → D♯/A → C/F♯ → B°7`

This creates harmonic ambiguity and seductive dissonance. Initially presented in a question-and-answer format between Zahhak and Ahriman, their lines gradually synchronize, symbolizing Zahhak’s seduction and fall.

### Jinxed Recipe
An imagined interlude dramatizing a scene in which demonic forces concoct a cursed dish for Zahhak.  
- Meter: **7/8**, with a pizzicato ostinato in the strings  
- Modal colors: **Hijaz** and **Shur**, passed between woodwinds in a playful Q&A  
- Transition: Shifts to **6/8**, slows as Zahhak tastes the food  
- Orchestration: String tremolos, flutter-tongued flutes/clarinets, bucket- and Harmon-muted brass  
- Climactic halt leads directly into the next theme

### Snakes Theme
Represents Zahhak’s curse:  
- Fast, trill-based gestures and ascending/descending figures (Shepherd’s Tone–inspired)  
- Cello tremolos punctuate the texture, suggesting repeated — and failed — attempts to remove the snakes  
- Relentless motion hints at endless torment

---

## Phase II – Reign of Terror

This section represents Zahhak’s oppressive rule. The atmosphere is bleak, suspended, and increasingly claustrophobic.

### Reign of Terror Texture
- Grave tempo with hanging harmonic progression  
- Chords closely voiced (minor/major seconds) with smooth voice leading and canonic layering  
- Cross-fading dynamics: crescendos/decrescendos **from and to niente**  
- Inspired by **Ligeti’s micropolyphony**, but retains a tonal center

### Serenade for Arnavāz and Shahrnāz
A moment of sorrow centered on Jamshid’s captured sisters.  
Written for **string soloists** (Violin I & II, Viola, Cello, Bass) and **winds**.

**Influence:** Arvo Pärt’s *Tintinnabuli* style  
- **T-voice:** triadic, slow (strings & clarinets)  
- **M-voice:** stepwise melodic (oboe, English horn, flutes in unison)  
- Violin I arpeggiates a combined texture, moving between stepwise motion and triads  

Gradual ritardando and pizzicato breakdown → accelerates into next section.

### Zahhak’s Nightmare
Depicts Zahhak’s fear of Fereydun and his eventual fall.  
- Harmonic palette: **whole-tone scale** blended with other modes  
- Orchestration: stark timbral contrasts, layered textures  
- Represents the unraveling of Zahhak’s psyche

---

## Phase III – The Tale of Fereydun

Introduces the hero Fereydun and his rebellion against Zahhak.  
The music becomes brighter, more active, and harmonically driven.

### Fereydun Leitmotif
- Mirrors Zahhak’s motif, but transformed into **Dorian mode**, symbolizing renewal  
- Harmony uses **Neo-Riemannian transformations (L, P, R)** to express emotional complexity and inevitability

### Battle Theme
- Built on **Perpetuum mobile** figures (fast, unrelenting motion)  
- Fuses Fereydun’s and Zahhak’s themes into a musical confrontation  
- Concludes with a **Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC)** to signal Fereydun’s victory

---

## Epilogue – Dawn (Chahārmezrāb)

The closing section is a bittersweet dance, inspired by **Chahārmezrāb**, traditionally played on the santoor.  
- Rhythmically joyful but carries an undertone of mourning  
- Ideophonic textures imitate santoor resonance  
- Symbolizes dawn and renewal — but also the lingering scars of tyranny
